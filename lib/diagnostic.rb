# Question 1
#
# In a Ruby comment, explain Behavior Driven Development, how it is meant to be
# used, and how it differs from Test Driven Development.

# BBD tests are generated with the statement As a User, I want to do some Action,
# So I can ...., You write you code to make the statement work.
# While TDD, you write you tests first, they are failing, then
# you write the code(classes) that make the tests pass. These are similar to
# Unit Tests.

#
# Question 2
#
# Create a request spec for our Examples API that ensures 'GET /examples'
# responds successfully and lists all examples.

RSpec.describe 'Examples API' do
  def examples
    Example.all
  end

  def example
    Example.first
  end
end

#
# Question 3
#
# Create a routing spec for our `Examples` resource that ensures
# GET /examples/:id routes to the examples#show action.

RSpec.describe 'routes for examples' do
  it 'routes GET /examples to the examples#index action' do
    # setup

    # action

    # assert
    expect(get('examples')).to route_to('examples#index')
    # teardown
  end
end

#
# Question 4
#
# Test that a POST action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_params
    {
      name: 'Example name',
      body: 'What a fantastic example this is...'
    }
  end

  describe 'POST create' do
    before(:each) do
      post :create, params: { example: example_params }
    end

    skip 'is successful' do
    end

    skip 'renders a JSON response' do
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 5
#
# Test that a PATCH action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders a JSON response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example_diff
    {
      body: 'This actually isn\'t that fantastic of an example...'
    }
  end

  describe 'PATCH update' do
    before(:each) do
      patch :update, id: example.id,
      params: { example: example_diff }

    it 'is successful' do
      expect(response).to be_success
    end

    it 'return an empty repsonse' do
      example_response = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(example_response).to be_empty
      expect(example_response[:body]).to eq(example_response[:body])
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 6
#
# Test that a DELETE action from our ExamplesController is both successful
# and renders an empty response.

RSpec.describe ExamplesController do
  def example
    Example.first
  end

  describe 'DELETE destroy' do
    it 'is successful and returns an empty response' do
      delete :destroy, params: {id: example.id}

      expect(response).to be_successful
      expect(response.body).to be_empty
    end
  end
end

#
# Question 7
#
# Test that the Example model has an association with an
# `other` model. You'll have to build an `association` model
# on your own.

RSpec.describe Example do
  describe 'associations' do
    # association method here

    # test association with `other` here
  end
end
